# Amazone Clone

This project closely mirrors the design of Amazon's E-Commerce platform, making it nearly indistinguishable. This is puring built to challenge my CSS skills so there won't be any Product page, Cart system or Payment Gateway. For those interested in a more comprehensive e-commerce experience, I have also developed an original and fully functional e-commerce platform, which you can explore  [here](https://github.com/vishal-gg/E-Commerce).
